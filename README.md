# Secure Chat Room
## About
A secure chat room application written in Python using TKinter & based on RabbitMQ broker using open-LDAP for authentication


# Learning objectives
When we've completed this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:

- Objective 1: LDAP server configuration, helping us manage user authentication.
- Objective 2: How to set up an authority server that accepts certification requests, creates them, then signs them in order to verify their state
- Objective 3: How to use RabbitMQ for chatting, which is an enterprise level tool
- Objective 4: How to use google authentificator to generate Qrcode for users authentification
